			<h1>Jiwon Kwon Blog</h1>
			<p>
				Hi, I'm Jiwon Kwon. I'm a CS student who loves writing what I thought and learned. 
				Currently I'm studying about web development and infra. Big fan of Java and Rust, also I often make new goofy projects. 
				Sometimes they are useful tho ðŸ˜…  
			</p>

			<p>
				I do love collaborating with people no matther which field they are in. 
				I made some Raspberry pi covered with resins and the website that converts user's photo and show it as encoded.
				Check it on the project page if you got some interests.
