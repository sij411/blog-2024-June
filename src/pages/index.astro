				Hi, I'm Jiwon Kwon. I'm a CS student who loves writing what I thought and learned. 
				Currently I'm studying about web development and infra. Big fan of Java and Rust, also I love making goofy side projects. 
			</p>

			<p>
				I do love collaborating with people no matther which field they are in. 
				<a href="https://body-as-data.vercel.app/"><h5>[The newest project] Body-as-data </h5></a>
				> I made some Raspberry pi covered with resins and the website that converts user's photo and show it as encoded.
				Check it on the project page if you are interested.
